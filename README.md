#  QA Error Inspector – Chrome DevTools Extension

##  Overview

QA Error Inspector is a Chrome DevTools extension built for Quality Analysts and Testers to automatically detect and display:

-  Failed REST APIs (4xx / 5xx)
-  GraphQL errors (errors[])
-  Asset failures (SVG, JS, images)
-  Request payloads
-  Error responses

This eliminates the need to manually inspect Network  Preview  Response during testing.

##  Problem It Solves

During QA testing, identifying why a feature fails often requires:

- Opening DevTools
- Navigating to Network tab
- Searching failed requests
- Checking payloads and responses manually

This process is slow and repetitive.

 **QA Error Inspector automates this entire flow.**

##  Key Features

-  Listens to all network requests in real time
-  Detects HTTP errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
-  Detects GraphQL errors[]
-  Shows:
  - API URL
  - HTTP method
  - Status code
  - Request payload
  - Error response
-  Designed specifically for QA workflows
-  Runs inside Chrome DevTools

##  Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- Chrome Extension (Manifest v3)
- Chrome DevTools API
